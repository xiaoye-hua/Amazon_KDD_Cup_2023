# Basic idea
Compared to [OTTO â€“ Multi-Objective Recommender System competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/otto-recommender-system/data)

1. might only one action
2. only one item as target, might be possible to extend the training data


# Basic Plan

1. Structure 
    1. Candidate generation
        1. [ ] i2i
            1. [ ] only keep specific country
            2. [ ] train & test data both included 
            3. [ ] fallback logics
        2. [ ] u2i (ALS)
            1. [ ] item similarity or sth??
        3. [ ] popular item in the same category
    2. Rank
        1. [ ] rule-based as first version
2. [ ] Text info (text and title info)
    1. [ ] text embedding as features
    
# TODO 

1. [ ] check previous trivago session-based competition
